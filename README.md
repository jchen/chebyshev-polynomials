# Trigonometry and a Sequence of Polynomials
## Abstract
We explore a sequence of polynomials related to the expansion of cos(nx)
for natural numbers n. We analyze various patterns concerning the coefficients
of these polynomials, along with a recursive formula to build later polynomials
from earlier polynomials. In addition, we conjecture explicit formulas for
these polynomials as well as polynomials related to the expansions of sin(nx)
and tan(nx) and prove a different explicit formula using generating functions.
Finally, we perform visual analyses of the graphs of the polynomials and their
behaviour when taken modulo p for odd primes p.
